# http-server

Trying to write an http server from scratch in C

Don't actually use this lol

Built with help from https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/

## How to run

First, compile with gcc:
```bash
$ gcc -o server server.c
```

Then, run the executable:
```bash
$ ./server
```

The server will be hosting on port 8888. To see the response, navigate to `localhost:8888`.
